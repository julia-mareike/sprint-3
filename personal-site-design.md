What is your site's primary purpose?

The two main purposes are to use the site as a repository for assignments and files, and also as a tool to practice webdesign without it actually needing to look very nice (just work, hopefully!)

Who is your target audience?

Probably the only people who will look at this is the EDA teachers and other students in my cohort.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I would like the site to be easy to navigate, not too cluttered and not too much going on. It would be great to have some cool features eventually in terms of UI, though it might take me a while to work that out. I would also like to have content that isn't just assignments / blogs, when I have time and skills to start trying out some project ideas.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

I think I'll try a minimalist design at first, though it might look cliched and boring - that way I can work my way up from a simple page, and it won't seem too overwhelming a task when I need to redesign or reshuffle content.
